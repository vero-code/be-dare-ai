I need an idea:
Create an API function that returns a creative content idea or writing prompt for a blogger.
The idea should be fresh, inspiring, and tailored for someone experiencing writer’s block.
Use Gemini (via Pica) and generate a response based on a random instruction or context.
Return the generated idea as a short string.

Support Me:
Create an agent that supports a content creator who is feeling burnout from editing. 
When the user clicks a button labeled “Support Me,” the agent generates a short motivational message 
(using Gemini 1.5-flash) and converts it to speech (using ElevenLabs).

I Published:
Create an agent that congratulates a blogger who has just published new content.
When the user clicks a button labeled "I Published!", the agent generates a kind, supportive, and motivational message (using Gemini 1.5-flash).
The message should be tailored for someone who has just shared their work and needs encouragement.
Return the generated message as a short plain text string.
